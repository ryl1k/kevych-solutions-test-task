# Kevych Solutions Trainee AI-Specialist test task

# Part 1: Intelligent Lead Data Extraction & Insight Generation

For this part, I built a script that extracts structured company information from text using the Groq API and a custom JSON schema.

Main points:
- Used Groq API for testing
- Designed a clear schema with inferred fields such as company focus, contacts, and summary.
- Modified system prompt to match schema

How to run:

- Modify .env via .env.example
- Go to task1 folder:
``cd task1``
- Install dependencies (if not installed):
``npm install``
- Start with npm:
``npm start``

Results will appear in:
- In file result/company_data.json 
- Console.
